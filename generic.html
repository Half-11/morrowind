								<p>Patch for Purists strives to be a all-in-one patcher for everything in the The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition that is considerd a bug. I define a bug as: 'an immersion breaking issue which was clearly not intended by the developers'. This definition has been the benchmark by the careful selection (and editing) of fixes from the Morrowind modding community. Patch for Purists covers almost every aspect of the game. A complete overview of fixes can be found in the ReadMe. A seperated .esp file is included with patched versions of all eight official add-ons released by Bethesda.</p>
								<p><b>What distinguishes the Patch for Purists from existing player made patches?</b><br />
								My purist approach kept me from introducing debatable and unnecessary changes: balance chanches based on personal preferences, so-called improvements in gameplay, and adding of unnecessary stuff. These are changes which, according to me, do not belong in a bugfixing patch because they go beyond fixing unintentional immersion breaking issues. Unfortunately, these are the exact changes that plague most player made patches. These patches force purists to play an outdated version of the game [v1.6.3b] and alter the experience of new players who are not aware of these unnecessary changes to the original game, as was intended by the developers.</p>
								<p><b>Credits</b><br />
								Patch for Purists is dedicated to the many players who contributed to this patch in one way or the other. Without their commitment this would not exist. This patch started initially as an complement of the Unofficial Morrowind Patch 1.6.3b by Thepal which, although a little bit outdated, seems to be the praised standard for player made patches. Because the logs of this former patch are vague and limited, it is not possible to find out exactly who contributed to this. To prevent a similar issue, I have made a complete and transparent log of used fixes. An additional advantage is that everyone can see what and how things are fixed.</b><br />
								Thanks to Bethesda Softworks for developing Morrowind and the Construction Set.</p>
