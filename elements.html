									<h1>Mods:<br />
									Hidden Gems</h1>
									<p>With the massive Morrowind modding community and the limited scope of modding<br />
									guides, it is no surprise that there are many noteworthy mods that are under the radar.<br />
									Here are my personal favourite hidden gems.</p>
								</header>
						
									<!-- Text stuff -->
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									
									<hr />
									<h3>Animated Gondoliers by Arcimaestro Antares</h3>
									<p>As the name suggests <a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-26-6230">Animated Gondoliers</a> adds two animated Gondoliers to Vivec. The Gondoliers add a sense of life to the city, by simply sailing furth and back.<p>
									<div class="box alt">

											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>		

									<hr />
									<h3>Blight Bounties v1.01 by Ivza</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-35-5935">Blight Bounties</a> makes the Temple reward players for killing blighted creatures. The rewards can be collected by visiting one of the three specialized Temple representatives either at Molag Mar, Maar Gan or Ghostgate (Tower of Dusk).<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Clean Beds for Rent by Havokk</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-55-1283">Clean Beds for Rent</a> adds previously missing rentable beds and publicans to the  towns of Dagon Fel (The End of the World), Gnisis (Madach Tradehouse), Suran (Suran Tradehouse) and Molag Mar (St. Veloth Hostel, The Pilgrim's Rest). Also some of these publicans are now little bit less generic than usual.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Cleansing Ash Statues by twilotspankle</h3>
									<p>Did you also end up not knowing what to do with those pesky ash statues? <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44801/?">Cleansing Ash Statues</a> makes it possible to turn them in for gold in return. Talk to Athaso Salas in the Ald-ruhn Temple who is responsible for cleansing ash statues.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Clear Your Name by Lucevar</h3>
									<p>Nolus Atrius is a corrupt magistrate mentioned in vanilla dialogue, the guy the Camonna Tong is paying to look the other way. However, Bethesda never placed him in game. <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43786/?">Clear Your Name</a> creates a small office for him at the back of Fort Moonmoth. Any player can ask him to get rid of their bounty; he'll do so at the discount you normally get for voluntarily turning yourself in to a guard, and he won't take your stolen stuff (just like the Thieves Guild). He also has some custom dialogue and if you ask him about rumours, he'll point you to a couple of obscure vanilla side quests in the Balmora area.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Concept Art Vivec Face Replacement v2.0 by Sigourn</h3>
									<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/5xe8yxeievb0d67/Concept+Art+Vivec+Face+Replacement+V2.zip">Concept Art Vivec Face Replacement</a> makes Vivec look like Bethesda's concept art for Morrowind. This replacer goes really well with vanilla textures and makes Vivec more awesome.<p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>
								
									<hr />
									<h3>Dwemer Books v1.1 by Misty Moon</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-11-11770">Dwemer Books</a> adds the mesh and texture (included on the Construction Set CD but not used in the game) to the Dwemer books in Vvardenfell. It remains a question as to why Bethesda chose to not use it.<p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic20.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>		
									<hr />
									<h3>Hortator Nerevarine Fix by hollaajith</h3>
									<p>Did you know that when your character's level and reputation are too high, you skip a certain part of the main quest? <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43097/?">Hortator Nerevarine Fix</a> prevents this from happening.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Improved Shrine Journal Entries by Nedlum</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-68-8221">Improved Shrine Journal Entries</a> improves the journal text caused by visiting the Temple shrines, to include the text revealed at each shrine. Simple but effective.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Kirkbride Books v0.2 by Adamant_2001</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-68-7547">Kirkbride Books</a> adds two books by Morrowind writer Michael Kirkbride (!) to the game; The 36 Lessons of Vivec Sermon Zero and Vivec's Gift. These books can be purchased at Sanaso Sarothran's bookstore in the Great Bazaar of Mournhold. Ask her about the Great Bazaar for more information on these books and how they arrived at the Bazaar.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Light The Way v1.0 by Enmesharra</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-53-6758">Light The Way</a> is a mod that adds a bit of atmosphere by adding lights to the outside transport NPC's, so they don't just stand out there in the dark. The Caravaners (Silt Strider) get torches, the Shipmasters and Gondaliers get lanterns.<p>
									<i>N.B. Although the link refers to the "tweaked" version 1.1, the original non-scripted version (which I personally prefer) can be found inside its folder.</i>

										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>
									<hr />
									<h3>Luminous Atronachs by PeterBitt</h3>
									<p><a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42613/?">Luminous Atronachs</a> adds glow maps to all three Atronachs in Morrowind, so that they glow in the dark. The base textures stay vanilla.<p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic19.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>		

									<hr />
									<h3>Mixed Guards v2.0 by ManaUser</h3>
									<p>There are several mods that make the monotonous guards more diverse in Morrowind. My personal favorite has always been the minimalistic <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/manauser/morrowind/">Mixed Guards</a>. What it does is creating diversity by adding female guards, without introducing extra's (quivers, new armor pieces, etc.) that break immersion.<p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>		
									
									<hr />
									<h3>Morrowind Go To Jail by LegoManIAm94</h3>
									<p>In vanilla Morrowind you are simply placed before the jail after you've supposedly been off your sentence. <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/37792/?">Morrowind Go To Jail</a> makes going to jail more like Oblivion. When you are taken to jail, you can now choose to serve your time by resting in a bedroll or try to escape.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Nighttime Door Locks v1.1a by LDones</h3>
									<p>Do you want to make wandering in the nights of Vvardenfell a bit more lonely and spooky? With <a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-53-2176">Nighttime Door Locks</a>, citizens and shopkeepers across Vvardenfell lock their doors at night (from 9pm to 8am). Inns, Guild Halls, certain tradehouses, and other appropriate buildings will remain unlocked through nighttime hours.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Persuasion Response Expansion v4.0 by Glassboy</h3>
									<p><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-1848">Persuasion Response Expansion</a> adds a whopping total of 703 new responses to Morrowind's existing responses for the four means of persuasion (Admire, Intimidate, Taunt, Bribe).<p>	 
								

									<hr />
									<h3>Quick Char v1.2 by Bink & MaXiMiUS</h3>
									<p>Every time you make a new character in Morrowind, you have to go through the tutorial. This can become tiresome at some point. With <a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-44-7364">Quick Char</a> you are given the option to skip the tutorial. If you choose so, each character creation screen pops up in order, and then you are moved in front of Sellus Gravius with your papers in your inventory.<p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>
									<hr />
									<h3>Realistic Lasting Lights v2.5 by Rianoris</h3>
									<p>In vanilla Morrowind a high quality lantern could only last up to  15 minutes. With <a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-37-6399">Realistic Lasting Lights</a> every light source which you can carry (torches, lanterns, buglamps, etc.), lasts much longer; up to four hours as opposed to the original 15 minutes.<p>
									<hr />
									<h3>Save Skill Books by Dormouse</h3>
									<p>Annoyed by the fact that in vanilla Morrowind skill increase automatically from reading certain books? With <a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-87-14029">Save Skill Books</a> a message box will appear when reading skill books, giving the player the option to either skim the pages or study the book. Skimming the pages allows the player to read the book without gaining the skill increase. Studying the book grants the skill increase to the player.<p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row 50% uniform">
											<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
														</div>							
																											
									<hr />
									<h3>Spell Scroll Text Overhaul v1.1 by Tizzo</h3>
									<p>In vanilla Morrowind, the majority of the spell scrolls found in the game read "Woe Upon You" in Daedric. <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42936/?">Spell Scroll Text Overhaul</a> changes the text of virtually every scroll in the game for the sake of variety.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Subtle Magic Glow by atteSmythe</h3>
									<p>Most modding guides suggest to remove the "plastic" magic glow effect altogether. Personally I like to see when an NPC wears enchanted clothing, and spot enchanted items lying around. <a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-35-10601">Subtle Magic Glow</a> replaces the original effect with a less-obtrusive, more transparent version.<p>
									<hr />
									<h3>Title Screen Reworked by Phobos</h3>
									<p>On widescreen resolutions the original mainmenu looks terrible, because the game stretches the image to make it fit. Although there is a lot of choice for mainmenu replacers, it is hard to find one that is faitfull to the original. Fortunately there <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43657/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fmorrowind%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D43657%26preview%3D&pUp=1">Title Screen Reworked</a> which meets this requirements.<p>
								
									<hr />
									<h3>Training Limit v1.2 by Adul</h3>
									<p>Do you have a hard time to get into the game because it is to easy to exploit the training system, causing lack of challenge? <a href="http://adul.net/?p=dl_mwmods_training_limit">Training Limit</a> tries to rebalance the training system by restricting the skill training sessions to 5 between each level up. Optional plugins are provided for 3, 7, or 10 training sessions per level, or 1, 2, or 3 training sessions per in-game day.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Traveling Merchants v2.3 by GhanBuriGhan & cyran0</h3>
									<p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~cyran0/TravelingMerchants.htm">Traveling Merchants</a> adds fourteen travelers to Morrowind; lorefiendly named NPC's that actually move between towns and add much needed live to the roads of Vvardenfell. Examples are a merchant with guar traveling between Seyda Neen and Pelagiad; a House Hlaalu courier delivering messages between Balmora and Caldera; and locals making the pilgrimage from Molar Mar to Mount Kand.<p>

									<hr />
									<h3>What Thieves Guild? v1.2 by Von Djangos</h3>
									<p>Ever felt that for a law breaking gang of thieves and robbers, finding the Thieves Guild was as easy as walking into a building? You practically get asked to join before you even realise its a thieves den. <a href="http://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/what-thieves-guild">What Thieves Guild?</a> aims to correct that. It'll take a little more care and winning of their trust to join them now.<p>
